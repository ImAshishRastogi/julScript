/*
*   - create sample.grammar in julius/model/
*   - create sample.voca in julius/model/
*   - create prompts.txt in julius/model/
*   - create MyDict.txt in julius/lexicon/
*   - generate wav files of samples of prompts.txt in julius/train/wav/
*   - run download_tools.php to download all required tools
*   - Run data_prep.php
*   - create 'hmmdefs'
*       Create a new file called hmmdefs in your 'julius/model/hmm0' folder:
*           > Copy the  monophones0 file to your hmm0 folder;
*           > rename the monophones0 file to hmmdefs;
*       For each phone in hmmdefs: 
*           > put the phone in double quotes;
*           > add '~h ' before the phone (note the space after the '~h'); and
*           > copy from line 5 onwards (i.e. starting from "<BEGINHMM>" to "<ENDHMM>") of the 
*           hmm0/proto file and paste it after each phone.
*           > Leave one blank line at the end of your file.
*   - Create 'macros' File
*       The final step in this section is to create the macros file.
*       A new file called macros should be created and stored in your 'julius/model/hmm0' folder:
*           > create a new file called macros in hmm0;
*           > copy vFloors to macros
*           > copy the first 3 lines of proto (from ~o to <DIAGC>) and add them to the top of the macros file
*   - Run step6.php
*       First copy the contents of the hmm3 folder to hmm4.  Then using an editor, 
*       create new "sp" model in hmm4/hmmdefs as follows:
*           > copy and paste the “sil” model and rename the new one “sp”(don't delete your old 
*           "sil" model, you will need it - just make a copy of it)
*           > remove state 2 and 4 from new “sp” model (i.e. keep 'centre state' of old “sil” 
*           model in new “sp” model)
*           > change <NUMSTATES> to 3
*           > change <STATE> to 2
*           > change <TRANSP> to 3
*           > change matrix in <TRANSP> to 3 by 3 array
